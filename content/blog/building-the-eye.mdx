# Building THE EYE

THE EYE started as a simple idea: what if your portfolio could watch you back? But like all good creative projects, it evolved into something much more interesting.

## The Concept

An eye that:
- **Tracks** your cursor with physics-based movement
- **Blinks** autonomously, like a living thing
- **Breathes** with organic pupil dilation
- **Jitters** with subtle micro-movements
- **Delivers** AI-generated daily insights

## The Technical Challenge

### Physics-Based Movement

The tracking needed to feel natural, not mechanical. The solution was a lerp (linear interpolation) with a carefully tuned factor:

```typescript
const lerpFactor = 0.12
currentPos.x += (targetPos.x - currentPos.x) * lerpFactor
currentPos.y += (targetPos.y - currentPos.y) * lerpFactor
```

This creates a smooth, weighted following motion that feels organic.

### Autonomous Behavior

The eye needed to feel alive even when you weren't moving. This meant:

- **Random blink intervals** (3-7 seconds)
- **Sine wave breathing** for pupil dilation
- **Micro-jitter** that triggers randomly

```javascript
// Breathing effect
const scale = 1 + Math.sin(frame * 0.01) * 0.05
```

### The Oracle Feature

Integrating Gemini AI to generate daily insights added a mystical element. The eye became more than decoration—it became an interactive experience that offers wisdom.

## The Result

THE EYE has become a signature element of The Island. It sits in the navigation, watching over every page, occasionally offering insights to curious visitors.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Physics matters**: Small details in movement create believability
2. **Autonomy adds life**: Random, organic behaviors make things feel alive
3. **Constraints breed creativity**: Working with SVG forced elegant solutions
4. **Details compound**: Each small touch (jitter, breathing, blinking) adds up

THE EYE watches over The Island, a guardian and guide for all who visit.
